# Data-Structures

These are some sample projects I have worked on for C343 Data Structures at Indiana University.  I plan to add them one by one as I improve both the efficiency and accuracy of these programs from when I submitted them for the class.  I am doing this to simply admire the progress I have made in programming from when I started during my undergrad years at Indiana.  It has still been a difficult road for me but I already got a few of them done!

An important note to those who are CURRENTLY TAKING THIS CLASS:<br/>
I have no problem if you want to use my code as simply guide to help your learning.  However, I absolutely DO NOT condone the use of plagiarism or submission of work that is not your own.  I will not be held responsible for those who choose to copy and paste my code for submission.  If you wish to use my code for anything related to the class, I would very much appreciate it if you could send me an email at jbsommers95@gmail.com stating your name and which sections of the code you plan on using.  Thank you!
